# ECS-171-ProjectG15

To run the demo (tested on Windows):

Run the server using Terminal with the appropriate command. It may look something like: py -m flask --app [filename.py] run

Then, go to a web browser and type in the following: localhost:5000.

After typing that, the screen should appear. You can then enter data into the window, and it will send the appropriate request to the server after clicking Predict. Note that this uses the form tag, which is not the safest approach (if you've had a class like ECS 162), but it saves another source file.

If you run into issues, a video has been provided with the submission to prove functionality. Depending on how your Python path variables are configured, you may need to experiment with using aboslute pathnames instead of relative pathnames.
